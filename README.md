# two_modes_of_hemodynamics

## preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.08.570806v1

This is the code associated with the article "Two distinct modes of hemodynamic responses across the human cortex" (in submission process), by Samira M. Epp, Gabriel Castrillon, Beijia Yuan, Jessica Andrews-Hanna, Christine Preibisch, Valentin Riedl (2023). 
All raw and processed data are available in this online repository of [Openneuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004873).


The mqBOLD processing of MRI data for T2, T2*, R2', CBV, OEF, and CBF parameter maps is based on MATLAB code developed by the MR physics group of Christine Preibisch (Institute for Neuroradiology, Technical University of Munich), which can be found here: https://gitlab.lrz.de/nmrm_lab/public_projects/mq-bold 

The input for all scripts in this github repository (two_modes_of_hemodynamics) are preprocessed nifti files, output of the mqBOLD processing, accessible in the mentioned repository. 
Scripts are .ipynb files, python based.
They need to be run in the order following their alphabetical numbering (A_ ... F_) 





```console
$ git clone https://github.com/NeuroenergeticsLab/two_modes_of_hemodynamis
