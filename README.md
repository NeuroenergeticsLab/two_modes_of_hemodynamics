# two_modes_of_hemodynamics

## preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.08.570806v1

This is the code associated with the article "Two distinct modes of hemodynamic responses across the human cortex" (in submission process), by Samira M. Epp, Gabriel Castrillon, Beijia Yuan, Jessica Andrews-Hanna, Christine Preibisch, Valentin Riedl (2023). 
All raw and processed data, needed to run these scripts, are available in this online repository of [Openneuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004873).
The input for all scripts are preprocessed nifti files, found in the mentioned repository. 
Scripts are .ipynb files. 
They need to be run in the order following their alphabetical numbering (A_ ... F_) 

The mqBOLD scripts to preprocess the raw data and calculate all mqBOLD parameter maps (T2, T2*, R2', CBV, OEF and CBF) were developed by Prof. Christine Preibisch et al. and are to be found here: https://gitlab.lrz.de/nmrm_lab/public_projects/mq-bold (matlab-based)
